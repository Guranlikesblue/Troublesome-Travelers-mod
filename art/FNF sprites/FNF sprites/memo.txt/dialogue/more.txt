GF: Wow, the microphone stand is broken completely!
Rum: I've strained my hand grabbing it too much…I'm sorry…
Rum: Wait, the microphone still works!
GF: Do you want to rap again?"
Rum: Of course!
GRRRRR…
GF: Wha…What was that!?
Rum: …My stomach growled…
GF: So you're extremely hungry, aren't you?
Rum: Maybe thirty minutes have passed since I strayed from my sister…
Rum: so I haven't eaten anything for an hour! I'm soooooo hungry…
GF: (Do humans starve that quickly??)
GF: …Never mind, let's start!
